# Homeautomation Client

This is the client for my home automation go project. As documented this is a private project.
I am building this client with polymer and maybe later Angular JS 2.0.

# Installation

Detailed notes will come in the next commits since I am still sorting out how to create this project.
For now it is enough to run npm install & bower install after clone.
To start a server and compile project simply run gulp or gulp debug.

# Project in development and does not offer any functionality yet.
